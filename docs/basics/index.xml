      <description>Text produced by NuKeeper falls into two categories: logging and output. Both can be independently sent to console, or to file, or turned off. Both default to the console.
Options related to logging are verbosity, logdestination and logfile. Options related to output are outputformat, outputdestination, and outputfile
If the run of NuKeeper is intended to produce Pull Requests, then output and logging is less important. But if the run is intended to inspect local code or remote repositories, the output is the primary result of the run.</description>

      <description>If you have a custom or private NuGet feed, it is recommended that you use a NuGet.config file in your repository. It will be used by NuKeeper, and by other tools. You can specify a list of NuGet sources on the command line. e.g.
nukeeper update --source https://api.nuget.org/v3/index.json --source http://packages.mycompany.com/nugetfeed  If you override this, you can chose to include the global public api.nuget.org feed or not. You may not need to, if your internal feed proxies the nuget.</description>
